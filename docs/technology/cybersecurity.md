## Security Fundamentals {#fundamentals}

### Overview

Security fundamentals form the foundation of all cybersecurity practices. Understanding these core principles helps organizations build robust security programs and protect critical assets from evolving threats.

### Core Concepts

#### CIA Triad

The CIA triad represents the three fundamental principles of information security:

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized parties
- **Integrity**: Maintaining data accuracy and trustworthiness
- **Availability**: Ensuring systems and data are available when needed

> **Example: CIA in Banking**
> 
> A bank's online system demonstrates the CIA triad:
> - Confidentiality: Encryption of customer data
> - Integrity: Transaction verification systems
> - Availability: Redundant systems and backups

::: tip Pro Tip
Always evaluate security controls against all three CIA principles.

#### Authentication and Authorization

Authentication verifies identity, while authorization controls access rights.

| Aspect | Authentication | Authorization |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Purpose | Proves identity | Controls access |
| Methods | Passwords, biometrics | ACLs, RBAC |
| Timing | Before access | After authentication |

### Common Implementation Methods

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Something you know (password)
   - Something you have (token)
   - Something you are (biometric)

2. **Access Control Models**
   - Discretionary (DAC)
   - Mandatory (MAC)
   - Role-based (RBAC)

::: warning Important
Never rely on single-factor authentication for critical systems.
