# Computer Vision

Computer vision enables machines to understand and process visual information from the world, mimicking human visual perception. This field combines image processing, pattern recognition, and deep learning to extract meaningful information from images and videos.

## Image Processing

### Image Preprocessing

**Definition**: Image preprocessing involves transforming raw images into a format more suitable for analysis through various cleaning and enhancement techniques.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Normalization**: Scaling pixel values to a standard range
- **Augmentation**: Creating variations of training images
- **Filtering**: Removing noise and enhancing features
- **Resizing**: Standardizing image dimensions

**Common Applications**:
- Medical image analysis
- Satellite imagery processing
- Quality control in manufacturing
- Security system feeds

**Example**:

> **Medical Image Enhancement**
> 
> Preparing X-ray images for automated diagnosis.
> 
> **Steps**:
> 1. Noise reduction using Gaussian filtering
> 2. Contrast enhancement
> 3. Standardization to 512x512 pixels
> 4. Intensity normalization to [0,1] range
>
> **Key Points**:
> - Improves feature visibility
> - Reduces processing artifacts
> - Ensures consistent input format

### Feature Extraction

**Definition**: Feature extraction identifies distinctive characteristics in images that are useful for classification or detection tasks.

**Key Components**:
- Edge detection algorithms
- Corner detection
- Texture analysis
- Shape descriptors

## Vision Applications

### Object Detection

**Definition**: Object detection combines localization and classification to identify and locate specific objects within images.

**Key Technologies**:
- YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- R-CNN family
- SSD (Single Shot Detector)
- RetinaNet

::: warning Important
Real-time object detection requires careful balance between accuracy and processing speed.

### Image Segmentation

**Definition**: Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into distinct regions or segments, often for the purpose of simplifying analysis.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Semantic Segmentation**: Classifying each pixel into a category
- **Instance Segmentation**: Differentiating between separate objects of the same class
- **Panoptic Segmentation**: Combining semantic and instance segmentation

**Common Applications**:
- Autonomous driving (road, vehicles, pedestrians)
- Medical image analysis (tumor detection, organ segmentation)
- Image editing and manipulation
- Object tracking in videos

**Example**:

> **Autonomous Vehicle Navigation**
> 
> Using segmentation to identify drivable areas, obstacles, and lane markings.
> 
> **Process**:
> 1. Capture video stream from cameras
> 2. Apply real-time segmentation
> 3. Detect and track objects (cars, pedestrians)
> 4. Navigate based on segmented output
>
> **Key Points**:
> - Critical for safe and efficient navigation
> - Requires high accuracy and low latency
> - Combines with other sensors (LiDAR, radar) for robustness

### Facial Recognition

**Definition**: Facial recognition is a technology that identifies or verifies a person's identity using their facial features.

**Key Components**:
- Face detection
- Feature extraction (landmarks, embeddings)
- Matching and recognition

**Common Applications**:
- Security and surveillance
- User authentication
- Emotion recognition
- Human-computer interaction

**Example**:

> **Smartphone Unlocking**
> 
> Using facial recognition to unlock a phone.
> 
> **Process**:
> 1. Capture face image using front camera
> 2. Extract facial features (eyes, nose, mouth)
> 3. Compare with stored features
> 4. Unlock if match is found
>
> **Key Points**:
> - Must be fast and accurate
> - Needs to work in various lighting conditions
> - Should preserve user privacy and data security
