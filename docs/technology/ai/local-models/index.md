# How to run AI models locally

Running AI models locally can be a great way to experiment with machine learning without relying on cloud services. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run AI models on your own machine.

## Why Run AI Models Locally?
- Full control of your data and privacy
- Lower latency since no network delay is involved
- Avoidance of cloud costs
- Independence from internet connectivity
- Hands-on experience for learning and development

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements
- **CPU/GPU**: AI models can run on both, but NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is recommended
- **Memory**: 16GB+ RAM recommended
- **Storage**: Several GB of free space (varies by model size)
- **OS**: Windows, Linux, or macOS (Linux preferred)

### Software Setup
1. Install Python 3.8 or later
2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv ai-env
source ai-env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
ai-env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```
3. Install required frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow)

## Getting Started

1. Choose a suitable model size (start with 3B or 7B parameters)
2. Download model weights from trusted sources
3. Use appropriate tools based on your needs
4. Monitor system resources during operation

## Best Practices
- Start with smaller models
- Enable privacy settings
- Monitor resource usage
- Keep models and tools updated
- Use local runners when possible
