# Deep Learning

Deep learning represents a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. It has revolutionized AI by enabling breakthrough advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and many other domains.

## Neural Network Fundamentals

### Architecture Basics

**Definition**: Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks, composed of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transmit information.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Neurons**: Basic computational units that process input signals
- **Layers**: Groups of neurons (Input, Hidden, Output layers)
- **Weights & Biases**: Adjustable parameters that determine network behavior
- **Activation Functions**: Non-linear functions that enable complex pattern learning

**Common Applications**:
- Image and speech recognition
- Language translation
- Game playing AI
- Pattern detection

**Example**:

> **Simple Image Classification Network**
> 
> Consider a neural network designed to classify handwritten digits (0-9).
> 
> **Architecture**:
> - Input Layer: 784 neurons (28x28 pixel image)
> - Hidden Layer 1: 128 neurons with ReLU activation
> - Hidden Layer 2: 64 neurons with ReLU activation
> - Output Layer: 10 neurons with Softmax activation
> 
> **Key Points**:
> - Each layer transforms the input data
> - Deeper layers learn more abstract features
> - Final layer outputs probability distribution over classes

**Analysis**: This architecture progressively learns features from pixels to edges to shapes to digits, demonstrating the power of hierarchical feature learning in deep networks.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

**Definition**: RNNs are a class of neural networks designed for processing sequences of data by maintaining a hidden state that captures information about previous inputs in the sequence.

**Key Components**:
- Recurrent layers
- Hidden state
- Sequence input
- Time steps

**Common Variants**:
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)

::: tip Pro Tip
Use RNNs for tasks where context and sequence order are important, like language modeling or time series prediction.

### Transformers

**Definition**: Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that relies on self-attention mechanisms to draw global dependencies between input and output. They are highly effective for sequential data and have become the foundation for state-of-the-art NLP models.

**Key Components**:
- Self-attention layers
- Positional encoding
- Feed-forward neural networks
- Layer normalization

**Common Applications**:
- Machine translation
- Text summarization
- Question answering
- Language modeling

::: danger Caution
Transformers are data-hungry and require careful tuning of hyperparameters. They also demand significant computational resources, especially for training.
